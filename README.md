Organize Imports Java is an Emacs plugin that helps add required imports 
and removes unused imports from `.java` file. The idea came from amazing 
IDE Eclipse's C-S-o key.

*P.S. Inspired by [Eclipse](https://www.eclipse.org/) organize imports preset behavior.*

## ‚ùì How to use?

1. Create an `oij.config` file at the version control root directory.
An example can be found below in the ‚ÄúConfig Example‚Äù section.
2. After you have included all the Java Libraries into the `oij.config`
file. You can run `organize-imports-java-do-imports` and it will load
the included jar path in the `oij.config` file and import in the current
buffer (It will take a while loading all the jar/lib files the first
time to create the cache file). If you wish to refresh the
paths-config.oij file then just call `organize-imports-java-reload-paths`
function, and it will do the work.

## ‚öôÔ∏è Config Example

This is an example of `oij.config` file. It Includes all the java library paths. 
This plugin can search for all the paths inside this jars files you include in this 
file.

```ini
#
# Include Java .jar file paths.
#

# Use JavaSE-1.7 Environment.
rt=::SDK_PATH::/jre/lib/rt.jar

# External Libraries
JCSQtJ-1.0.2=./test_lib/JCSQtJ-1.0.2.jar
qtjambi-4.8.7=./test_lib/qtjambi-4.8.7.jar

```

## üß™ Configuration

Setup Java JDK.

```el
(setq organize-imports-java-java-sdk-path "/path/to/java/jdk/")
```

Include all your library path in the file. Should place this file at the root of 
version control directory.

```el
(setq organize-imports-java-lib-inc-file "oij.config")
```

After reading all the library path, this file will be generated for cache search on 
what library should be import to current buffer/file.

```el
(setq organize-imports-java-path-jar-lib-cache-file "paths-cache.oij")
```

Local source will be loaded automatically after loaded all the external .jar files.
The local source file will depends on `organize-imports-java-source-dir-name`
variable path.

```el
(setq organize-imports-java-path-local-source-cache-file "paths-cache-local.oij")
```

This plugin detect each word's font face in the current buffer to find which word is
the class keyword to import. By setting this variable can add/remove the list of font
face you want this plugin to detect the class type.

```el
(setq organize-imports-java-font-lock-type-face '("font-lock-type-face"))
```

For some reason your project source files isn't under `src` folder. You can change it
by setting this variable.

```el
(setq organize-imports-java-source-dir-name "src")
```

If there are something that you do not usually want to import to your buffer, you can 
modified this variable and reload the cache files.

```el
(setq organize-imports-java-non-class-list '("Callable"
                                             "Runnable"))
```

## ‚å®Ô∏è Key Bindings

If you want, you can just bind the key to the function directly.

```el
;; Do the import, if could not find paths-config.oij file then it will
;; reload the paths once.
(define-key java-mode-map (kbd "C-S-o") #'organize-imports-java-do-imports)
```

## üéö Functions

Reload both local source and jar/lib Java path once. This will overwrite all the 
cache file and this call might take a while to complete.

```el
M-x organize-imports-java-reload-paths
```

Just reload the jar/lib Java path once. This should take a while because Java
API is HUGE!

```el
M-x organize-imports-java-reload-jar-lib-paths
```

Just reload the local source Java path once. The time consume should just
depends on how large is your current project.

```el
M-x organize-imports-java-reload-local-source-paths
```

## üßÆ Tips

* You can just delete either `organize-imports-java-path-jar-lib-cache-file`
or `organize-imports-java-path-local-source-cache-file` cache file in order
to refresh the cache, the cache file will be regenerated as long as you call any
reload paths function or do import function.
* You might want to reload local source cache every time you create a new `.java` 
file in your local source directory.

## üìù Some Possible Improvement

* Performance is terrible when loading all the jar files to path. Hopefully I can 
find out a way to get around this issue.

Install all dependencies and development dependencies:

```sh
$ eask install-deps --dev
```

To test package's installation:

```sh
$ eask package
$ eask install
```

To test compilation:

```sh
$ eask compile
```

**ü™ß The following steps are optional, but we recommend you follow these lint results!**

The built-in `checkdoc` linter:

```sh
$ eask lint checkdoc
```

The standard `package` linter:

```sh
$ eask lint package
```
